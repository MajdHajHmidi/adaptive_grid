# responsive_layout_grid

A lightweight Flutter widget that turns a list of widgets into a responsive grid layout using `flutter_layout_grid`. It automatically adjusts the number of columns based on screen width, a minimum item width, and configurable spacing.

Supports both regular and sliver-based grids out of the box.

## âœ¨ Features

- Fully responsive layout using `minimumItemWidth`
- Auto-calculated column count and row sizes
- Configurable `horizontalSpacing` and `verticalSpacing`
- Optional `SliverToBoxAdapter` support via `.sliver` constructor
- Built on top of the powerful `flutter_layout_grid`
