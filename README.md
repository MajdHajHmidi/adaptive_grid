# adaptive_grid

A lightweight Flutter widget that turns a list of widgets into a responsive grid layout using `flutter_layout_grid`. It automatically adjusts the number of columns based on screen width, a minimum item width, and configurable spacing.

Supports both regular and sliver-based grids out of the box.
